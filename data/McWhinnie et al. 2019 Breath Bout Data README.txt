McWhinine et al. 2019 Breath Bout Data README

Variables:

Block					Temporal block the measurements were taken in. Two blocks were acclimated and performed at a time, for a total of two times. These blocks were all over the summer of 2018.
Measurement				For the breath bouts, animals' performance was measured at one of two sequential time points; ZeroOne and ZeroTwo. Both measurements took place at zero days post acclimation.
FrogID					The measurement-specific identification code for each frog. Clarifies which block, performance measurement, and individiaul animal for those specific values.
VideoID					The identification of which Breath Bout within each specific performance measurement. Up to 3 breath bout periods were taken from each performance measurement from a given frog.
AccTemp					Temperature the animal was acclimated at for 17 days.
AccInc					Incubator number in which the animal was acclimated.
PerfTemp				Temperature at which the animals' metabolic performance was measured.
PerfInc					Incubator in which the animals' metabolic performance was measured.
Breaths					Total number of measured inhales and exhales for a given breath bout.
AvgMass(g)				Average mass of the animal between pre- and post-acclimation.
minTime(ms)				Start time for the individual breath bout.
maxTime(ms)				End time for the individual breath bout.
totalTime(s)				Total time for the individual breath bout in seconds.
totalTime(min)				Total time for the individual breath bout in minutes.
O2Measure(mLO2/mLAir)(sec)		Cumulative volumetric measurement of oxygen from the breath bout.
AvgFlowRate(SCCMAir/min)		Average flow rate of entire performance measurement in standard conditions (0oC, 1atm). Used to quantify amount of oxygen consumed.
CorrectedFlowRate(mLAir/min)		Flow rate of entire performance measurement at local environmental conditions (20oC, 1.002633atm). Incorporates temperature and atmospheric pressure of environment where measurements were taken.
AvgAirDensity(gAir/mLair)		Average air density of environment where measurements were taken between the months of June & July of 2018. Calculations based on weather data from a local weather station.
WeightPerc(gO2/gAir)			Standard value for weight percent of oxygen in air.
VolPerc(mLO2/mLAir)			Standard value for volume percent of oxygen in lair.
O2Consumed(mgO2)			Milligrams of oxygen consumed for the breath bout.
mgO2ConsPerBreath			Milligrams of oxygen consumed per breath for the breath bout.
negTotalFlow(mLAir/Min)(sec)		Total negative volume of air consumed. Indicative of inhalation from the animal.
posTotalFlow(mLAir/Min)(sec)		Total positive volume of air consumed. Indicative of exhalation from the animal.
BreathVolSCCM(mLAir/Min)(sec)		Summation of absolute values of negative + positive volumes of air cosumed by the animal. Equates to total volume of air respired during the breath bout. Values at standard conditions.
totBreathVolCorrected(mLAir/Min)(sec)	Summation of absolute values of negative + positive volumes of air cosumed by the animal. Equates to total volume of air respired during the breath bout. Values at local environmental conditions.
mLAirPerBreath				Milliliters of air consumed per breath.
