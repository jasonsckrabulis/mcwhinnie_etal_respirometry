McWhinine et al. 2019 Breath Bout Data README

Variables:

Block					Temporal block the measurements were taken in. Two blocks were acclimated and performed at a time, for a total of two times. These blocks were all over the summer of 2018.
FrogID					The measurement-specific identification code for each frog. Clarifies which block, performance measurement, and individiaul animal for those specific values.
MeasurementID				For the breath bouts, animals' performance was measured at one of two sequential time points; ZeroOne and ZeroTwo. Both measurements took place at zero days post acclimation.
AvgMass(g)				Average mass of the animal between pre- and post-acclimation.
AccInc					Incubator number in which the animal was acclimated.
AccTemp					Temperature the animal was acclimated at for 17 days.
PerfInc					Incubator in which the animals' metabolic performance was measured.
PerfTemp				Temperature at which the animals' metabolic performance was measured.
Breaths					Total number of measured inhales and exhales for a given breath bout.
BreathsPerMin     Number of total breaths taken per minute during the breath bout.
mgO2ConsPerBreath     Average mass of oxygen (in mg) consumed per breath.
mLAirPerBreath     Average volume of air (in mL) breathed per breath.
